This page describes how to select text, and introduces the mark, the point and the region.

# Basic

- `C-x h`: `mark-whole-buffer`, select all buffer.

# Mark

To set the mark:

- `C-SPC`: set the mark.  Once the mark is set, you can move your cursor as you want using arrow keys, or even using an incremental search, to adjust your selection.
