In a buffer, use `C-x C-j` to open the current directory in dired.

Once in a dired window (`M-x dired`), the following keys can be used:

- `d`: Mark for deletion
- `D` : Delete
- `u`: Unmark for deletion
- `x`: Delete files marked for deletion
- `f` : Visit file
- `o`: Visit file in other window
- `+`: Create new directory
- `C <name> RET`: Copy with a new name

The name of the files can also be edited directly in the dired buffer by making the buffer writable with `C-x C-q`.
